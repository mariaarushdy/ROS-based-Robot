# ROS2foxy-Based Robot Project

## Overview

This project presents a ROS (Robot Operating System) based robot equipped with a body, camera, and LIDAR sensor. The robot's physical attributes are defined using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files. It is designed to be compatible with both Gazebo control and ROS 2 Control for navigation.

The project is implemented using ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy.

## Features

- URDF files define the robot's structure and components.
- Integrated body, camera, and LIDAR sensor for comprehensive sensing capabilities.
- Supports Gazebo control for simulation.
- Utilizes ROS 2 Control for real-world robot control and navigation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy
- Gazebo (for simulation)
- ROS 2 Control (for real-world control)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your ROS workspace:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-robot-repo.git
    ```

2. Build the ROS workspace:

    ```bash
    cd your-work-space
    colcon build --symlink-install
    ```

3. Source the ROS workspace:

    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

## Usage

### Gazebo Simulation

To launch the robot in Gazebo simulation, use:

```bash
ros2 launch your_robot_package launch_sim.py
